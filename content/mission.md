## Mission

**SAIL MED** aims to advance the use of wind energy (sails) in cargo transport and passenger travel around the world, by linking together experts, industry stakeholders, researchers and all other interested parties who care about our mission and our goals to enhance local economic developments and food security, and to sail toward a sustainable Blue Economy that is free from a dependency on the worldâ€™s rapidly depleting and heavily polluting fossil fuels.

**SAIL MED** will focus first on Europe as its pilot area for partner and collaboration building, while opening our resources and networks worldwide, and will also pilot cargo sail transport projects in the Mediterranean region.
