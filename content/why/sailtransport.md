## Sail Transport

In the field of cargo transport by sail (Sail Transport), the renewable energy power (wind) and beauty of sailing is being combined with shipping innovations and local food production and trade. These groundbreaking developments focus both on technology (i.e., clean energy and wind propulsion), and community and regional developments. Sail Transport represents a future moving away from the highly polluting, heavily subsidized fossil fuel industry. Sail Transport also enhances direct involvement between trading communities. Sail Transport offers greater transparency in supply chains and mapping the impacts of trade.

The current Sail Transport goals of SAIL MED focus on:

 * - The use of existing sailboats for sail cargo transport
 * - Converting existing sailing and motor-powered vessels to full sailing capability
 * - Constructing new sailing or hybrid ships for trade and travel.
